-- 1907. Count Salary Categories
-- SOURCE:


-- PROBLEM:
-- Table: Accounts

-- +-------------+------+
-- | Column Name | Type |
-- +-------------+------+
-- | account_id  | int  |
-- | income      | int  |
-- +-------------+------+
-- account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
-- Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.

-- Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

-- "Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
-- "Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
-- "High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
-- The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

-- Return the result table in any order.

-- TABLE SCHEMA:
Create table If Not Exists Accounts (account_id int, income int)
Truncate table Accounts
insert into Accounts (account_id, income) values ('3', '108939')
insert into Accounts (account_id, income) values ('2', '12747')
insert into Accounts (account_id, income) values ('8', '87709')
insert into Accounts (account_id, income) values ('6', '91796')

-- SOLUTION:

SELECT
    "High Salary" as category,
    count(*) as accounts_count
from accounts
where income > 50000

union

SELECT
    "Low Salary" as category,
    count(*) as accounts_count
from accounts
where income < 20000

union

SELECT
    "Average Salary" as category,
    count(*) as accounts_count
from accounts
where income >= 20000 and income <= 50000
